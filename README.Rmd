## Quantile regression average

NB: This is a transient package that will probably be merged into the
[stackr package](https://github.com/nikosbosse/stackr). 

## Prerequisites

This depends on the [scoringutils](https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils)
package, which can be installed with 

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("epiforecasts/scoringutils")
```

The code itself can be tested by installing the corresponding package:
```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("epiforecasts/qra")
```

### calculate QRA

Create an ensemble for each location, and separately for cases and deaths, for the 24th of July 2021
```{r}
library("scoringutils")
example_quantile |>
  as_forecast() |>
  qra(
    group = c("target_type", "location", "location_name"),
    target = c(target_end_date = "2021-07-24")
  )
```
